## Things that I've learned..

* Used **Next.js** to write backend APIs code along with the frontend
* Got API keys from **[Alchemy]**(https://dashboard.alchemyapi.io/) and **[Rinkeby Faucet]**(https://rinkebyfaucet.com/)
* npm install **Web3Modal library** in order to connect dApp to the **Metamask** wallet
* Have an api route which **Opensea** can call to retrieve the metadata for the NFT
